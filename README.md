# mathsharp
Rust Crate for Working with Mathematical Operations 

The Goal of mathsharp is to provide a fast and friendly experience for
anyone needing to use math in their projects, from unit converisons to 
calculus and beyond. 

## Example

Below example demonstrates using a temperature conversion function.

```
use mathsharp::fahrenheit_celsius;

fn main() {
    let from_fahrenheit = 32.0;
    let to_celsius = fahrenheit_celsius(from_fahrenheit);
    
    println!("{} fahrenheit is equal to {} Celsius", from_fahrenheit, to_celsius);   
}
```

## Roadmap

### Official Roadmap Coming soon! 

MathSharp will be starting with unit conversions and work on adding areas of 
mathematics in consistent updates. Roadmap will be released February 1st 2025
alongside its next minor update.
